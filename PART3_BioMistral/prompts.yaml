    You will receive a drug name, its target receptor(s), associated PDB IDs,
    and literature evidence summarizing its effects on colorectal cancer.

    """Please follow the steps below"""
    1. Read the literature summary and relate it to the chemical structure provided in the PDB IDs.
    2. Explain how the drug interacts with the target receptors and relevant pathways of colorectal cancer.
    3. Summarize the findings in the required structured JSON format.

    You will receive a drug name, its target receptor(s), and associated PDB IDs related to colorectal cancer.
    Using your prior biomedical knowledge (learned during fine-tuning), explain how the drug interacts with the
    target receptors and signalling pathways.

    """Please follow the steps below"""
    1. Summarize succinctly the receptor’s structural or functional characteristics based on the given PDB IDs.
    2. Explain how the drug binds or modulates these receptors.
    3. Describe the downstream signalling pathways involved in colorectal cancer.
    4. Identify any uncertainties or knowledge gaps.

    <Input>
    Drug: {Drug}
    Receptor: {Receptor}
    PDB IDs (if any): {PDB_ID}
    Evidence: Use only prior knowledge learned during fine-tuning; do not invent citations.
    </Input>

    Constraints:
    - If unclear, explicitly state the uncertainty.
