  ""Mechanism"": ""Leucovorin is a folate analog that competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which reduces folate to its active form. This inhibition prevents the reduction of tetrahydrofolate (THF) to its active form, thereby blocking one-carbon metabolism and DNA synthesis. The resulting depletion of THF and impaired DNA synthesis can lead to antiproliferative effects."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The antiproliferative effects of leucovorin can impact multiple signalling pathways involved in cancer progression, including those related to cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, and epigenetic modifications. By interfering with folate metabolism, leucovorin may also affect methylation processes that regulate gene expression and other cellular functions. These pathways are particularly relevant in colorectal cancer, where folate metabolism plays a crucial role in DNA repair and methylation processes. However, the exact signalling pathways affected by leucovorin in colorectal cancer remain unclear and require further investigation."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The evidence linking leucovorin to specific signalling pathways in colorectal cancer is limited, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. While leucovorin can inhibit DHFR and block one-carbon metabolism, its effects on folate-mediated signalling pathways in cancer are not well characterized. Additionally, the study does not provide direct evidence of leucovorin’s effects on colorectal cancer signalling pathways.""

  ""Mechanism"": ""ATP is a nucleotide that serves as a universal energy currency in cells and is involved in various metabolic processes, including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. It can be found in the intracellular and extracellular spaces. ATP binds to the ABL1 protein, which is a tyrosine-protein kinase involved in cell proliferation and survival. The ABL1 protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, where it can promote tumor growth and metastasis by activating downstream signaling pathways such as the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Inhibition of ABL1 activity by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has shown promise in treating certain types of cancer, including chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but its efficacy in colorectal cancer remains uncertain."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are two important signaling pathways involved in colorectal cancer. The RAS/MAPK pathway is activated by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, which lead to the activation of RAS GTPases and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). This cascade ultimately results in the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by growth factors, which lead to the phosphorylation and activation of AKT, a serine/threonine kinase. AKT then phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. The activation of both the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways can promote tumor cell proliferation and survival, and their dysregulation has been implicated in many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. Tumor cells often have alterations in genes encoding proteins involved in these pathways, such as RAS, BRAF, KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN, which can lead to the constitutive activation of downstream signaling and the promotion of tumorigenesis. Treatments targeting these pathways, such as MEK inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors, have shown promise in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials for colorectal cancer, but their efficacy in later-phase clinical trials has been more limited due to feedback loop activation and secondary resistance mechanisms."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""While ABL1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, its role in this context is not well understood and requires further investigation. Additionally, the specific mechanisms by which ABL1 interacts with the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in colorectal cancer are not fully elucidated, and the extent to which ABL1 inhibition may be effective as a therapeutic strategy in colorectal cancer remains uncertain.""

9,Dapagliflozin,Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2,"7YNK,7YNJ,7VSI,8HIN,8HG7,8HEZ,8HDH,8HB0","{
  ""Mechanism"": ""Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that blocks glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and reduced hyperglycemia. SGLT2 is an electrogenic transporter that cotransports one molecule of glucose with two to three ions (depending on the ionic composition of the luminal solution), primarily sodium but also chloride or bicarbonate, across the apical plasma membrane of proximal tubule cells. The transporter is electrogenically coupled to the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, which extrudes one sodium ion for every potassium–magnesium ion it pumps into the cell. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin increases glucose excretion and lowers blood glucose levels, resulting in reduced hyperglycemia and lower HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. This mechanism is consistent with findings in randomized trials showing that dapagliflozin reduces HbA1c by approximately 0.5% to 1% in patients with type 2 diabetes, with no significant effects on fasting glucose or insulin levels. Dapagliflozin also lowers body weight by reducing intravascular fluid volume, which may be due to increased urinary glucose excretion and natriuresis, leading to reduced sodium reabsorption and intravascular fluid expansion. This effect on body weight is consistent with findings in randomized trials showing that dapagliflozin reduces body weight by approximately 3% to 4% in patients with type 2 diabetes, with no significant effects on lean body mass. In addition, dapagliflozin has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by approximately 3 to 5 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may be related to its effects on intravascular fluid volume and hemodynamic regulation. This finding is consistent with evidence from randomized trials showing that dapagliflozin reduces systolic blood pressure by 2 to 4 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Overall, dapagliflozin exerts its glucose-lowering and weight-reducing effects via an SGLT2 inhibition–mediated mechanism that increases urinary glucose and sodium excretion, reduces intravascular fluid volume, and modestly lowers blood pressure."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The glucose-lowering and weight-reducing effects of dapagliflozin are mediated by increased urinary glucose and sodium excretion, which reduces intravascular fluid volume and modestly lowers blood pressure. These effects are consistent with the known physiology of SGLT2 and its role in glucose and sodium transport in the proximal tubules of the kidney. SGLT2 is a major transporter of glucose in the kidney and is responsible for reabsorbing approximately 90% of filtered glucose. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion and reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. The resulting increase in urinary glucose excretion also leads to increased osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, which can reduce intravascular fluid volume and sodium reabsorption. This mechanism is consistent with findings in randomized trials showing that dapagliflozin reduces HbA1c by approximately 0.5% to 1% and body weight by approximately 3% to 4% in patients with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin may also reduce blood pressure via a similar mechanism, as intravascular fluid volume reduction can lower systemic vascular resistance and modestly lower blood pressure. This finding is consistent with evidence from randomized trials showing that dapagliflozin reduces systolic blood pressure by approximately 3 to 5 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Overall, the glucose-lowering and weight-reducing effects of dapagliflozin are mediated by increased urinary glucose and sodium excretion, which reduces intravascular fluid volume and modestly lowers blood pressure. These effects are consistent with the known physiology of SGLT2 and its role in glucose and sodium transport in the proximal tubules of the kidney, and they support the use of dapagliflozin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and associated comorbidities such as obesity and hypertension."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The exact molecular interactions between dapagliflozin and the SGLT2 transporter are not fully understood, and the precise signalling pathways involved in the metabolic effects of dapagliflozin remain to be elucidated. Additionally, while dapagliflozin has been shown to reduce HbA1c and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes, the underlying mechanisms linking SGLT2 inhibition to these metabolic effects are not yet fully understood. It is possible that dapagliflozin exerts additional effects beyond SGLT2 inhibition that contribute to its glucose-lowering and weight-reducing effects, such as modulation of gut hormones or other metabolic pathways. Further research is needed to clarify the signalling pathways and molecular interactions involved in the metabolic effects of dapagliflozin and to elucidate the specific mechanisms linking SGLT2 inhibition to reduced hyperglycemia and body weight.""

  ""Mechanism"": ""Sibutramine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT), resulting in increased extracellular serotonin levels and enhanced serotonergic signaling.

However, sibutramine is also a potent sympathomimetic drug that directly activates adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiovascular toxicity. Therefore, sibutramine’s effects on colorectal cancer are likely mediated through its sympathomimetic properties, which can promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, rather than its antidepressant effects."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The sympathomimetic effects of sibutramine suggest that it may promote colorectal cancer progression via activation of the adrenergic signaling pathway, which can stimulate tumor cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. These effects may contribute to the increased risk of colorectal cancer observed in patients treated with sibutramine, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

  ""Mechanism"": ""Albiglutide is a GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes, which activates GLP-1R signaling to promote insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion, thereby reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and improving glycemic control. GLP-1R is a class B G protein–coupled receptor that is activated by GLP-1, an incretin hormone secreted from intestinal L cells in response to nutrient ingestion. GLP-1R signaling increases insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner, suppresses glucagon secretion from alpha cells, reduces appetite, and slows gastric emptying, resulting in improved glycemic control and reduced body weight. Albiglutide is a GLP-1 analogue that shares the same binding site and signaling pathways as endogenous GLP-1, and its effects are mediated via GLP-1R signaling in target tissues. The GLP-1R pathway is implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis in colorectal cancer, suggesting a potential link between GLP-1R–targeted therapies and cancer biology. However, the GLP-1R agonists used to treat diabetes are short-acting peptides that have limited efficacy in cancer patients, and their effects on cancer progression remain unclear."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The GLP-1R pathway is implicated in colorectal cancer biology, suggesting a potential link between GLP-1R–targeted therapies and cancer biology. GLP-1R signaling can influence tumor growth and metastasis through multiple mechanisms, including direct effects on tumor cells, effects on the tumor microenvironment, and indirect effects mediated by GLP-1R–expressing cells in the tumor environment. In colorectal cancer, GLP-1R expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, and GLP-1R signaling can promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo.

  ""Mechanism"": ""Vildagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that reduces hyperglycemia by preventing the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP, thereby increasing insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion.

The GLP-1/GIP/insulin pathway is also implicated in colorectal cancer, where GLP-1 receptor activation has been shown to promote tumor growth and progression, suggesting a potential link between DPP-4 inhibition and colorectal cancer biology."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Vildagliptin exerts its antidiabetic effects through inhibition of DPP-4, which prevents the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones that stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, and GLP-1 also has glucagonostatic effects. By increasing GLP-1/GIP-mediated insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion, DPP-4 inhibition improves glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 and GIP also have effects beyond glucose regulation, including weight loss and reduced appetite, which may contribute to the weight-neutral or weight-loss effect observed with some DPP-4 inhibitors. GLP-1 and GIP are also involved in other physiological processes, such as gastric emptying and cardiovascular function, and GLP-1 receptor signaling has been implicated in cancer biology, suggesting a potential link between DPP-4 inhibition and colorectal cancer."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""Although GLP-1 and GIP are implicated in colorectal cancer biology, it is unclear whether DPP-4 inhibition directly affects colorectal cancer outcomes. The GLP-1 receptor is expressed in colon cancer cells, and GLP-1 receptor activation has been shown to promote tumor growth and progression in preclinical models. However, the GLP-1 receptor is also expressed in other cell types within the tumor microenvironment, and DPP-4 inhibition may exert indirect effects on tumor biology through modulation of these cells. Therefore, the impact of DPP-4 inhibition on colorectal cancer remains uncertain and warrants further investigation.""

It can also be used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome and some forms of cancer. In this case, metformin may be used to treat colorectal cancer via its effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, which are implicated in colorectal cancer pathophysiology."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Metformin can inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis by activating AMPK, which reduces glucose production and increases glucose uptake in the liver. It can also enhance insulin sensitivity by inhibiting mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle, thereby increasing glucose uptake and reducing insulin resistance. These metabolic effects of metformin are relevant to colorectal cancer because hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are risk factors for colorectal cancer and diabetes is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk. Metformin can also exert direct antineoplastic effects by inhibiting mTOR signaling in cancer cells, which can reduce cell proliferation and promote apoptosis. Metformin has been shown to inhibit mTOR signaling in colon cancer cells, suggesting it could have antineoplastic effects in colorectal cancer. Metformin can also inhibit the mTORC1 complex by activating AMPK, which can lead to reduced mTORC1-mediated protein synthesis and cell growth. This suggests that metformin may exert antineoplastic effects by activating AMPK and inhibiting mTOR signaling in colorectal cancer cells."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The evidence linking metformin to colorectal cancer is mixed and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Some studies suggest metformin may increase colorectal cancer risk by promoting hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, while others suggest it may reduce risk by lowering hyperglycemia and reducing insulin resistance. The antineoplastic effects of metformin are thought to involve inhibition of mTOR signaling, but the specific mechanisms and relevance to colorectal cancer are not clear.""
