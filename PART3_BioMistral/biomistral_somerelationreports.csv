This inhibition of dopamine signaling can lead to reduced prolactin secretion and thus decreased prolactin levels, which is used to treat hyperprolactinemia-related conditions such as prolactin pituitary adenomas and prolactin-dependent tumors (e.g., prolactin-secreting tumors)."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Prolactin-secreting tumors (e.g., prolactin pituitary adenomas) can cause hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to galactorrhea (milk-producing breast tissue) and amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods), resulting in infertility. Prolactin excess can also contribute to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels) and sexual dysfunction, and may increase the risk of breast cancer in women. In men, hyperprolactinemia can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Prolactin-secreting tumors are often treated with dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine) to reduce tumor size and prolactin levels, thereby alleviating symptoms and improving fertility and sexual function. This suggests that bromocriptine exerts its antitumor effects by blocking dopamine receptors on prolactin-secreting tumors, thereby reducing prolactin secretion and tumor growth. This supports a role for dopamine signaling in prolactin-secreting tumors and suggests that bromocriptine acts by inhibiting dopamine-mediated signaling pathways that promote tumor growth and proliferation in these tumors.

However, there is no evidence linking selegiline to colorectal cancer or colorectal cancer signalling pathways directly, so the relevance to CRC is unclear."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The biogenic amines regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis through multiple signalling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is implicated in CRC. Selegiline’s effects on biogenic amines suggest it might affect CRC signalling via this pathway, but there is no direct evidence of such an effect. Other pathways implicated in CRC include Wnt signalling, which regulates epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis, and the MAPK/ERK pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and survival. Selegiline’s effects on biogenic amines suggest it might affect CRC signalling via these pathways as well, but again, there is no direct evidence of such effects. Overall, while selegiline’s effects on biogenic amines suggest it might affect CRC signalling pathways, there is no direct evidence of such an effect, and the relevant mechanisms are unclear."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""Selegiline’s effects on biogenic amines suggest it might affect CRC signalling via multiple pathways, but there is no direct evidence of such effects. The relevant mechanisms are therefore uncertain.""

Lorazepam,Translocator protein,,"{
  ""Mechanism"": ""Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that binds to the translocator protein (TSPO) and acts as a positive allosteric modulator, increasing the affinity of ligands to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This stabilizes the GR in the cytosol and prevents its translocation into the nucleus, thereby inhibiting anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative signaling pathways."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The GR mediates anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects by regulating transcription of genes involved in immune response and cell cycle control. Inhibition of GR signaling may therefore promote inflammation and tumor growth, which could be relevant to colorectal cancer pathogenesis."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The provided evidence suggests a potential link between lorazepam and colorectal cancer via the GR, but it does not establish a direct causal relationship. Lorazepam’s effects on TSPO and GR signaling are well-established, but the relevance to colorectal cancer is less clear and supported by limited evidence.""

Alprazolam,Translocator protein,,"{
  ""Mechanism"": ""Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds to the translocator protein (TSPO) and modulates neuroinflammation, which can contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC). TSPO is a mitochondrial membrane protein expressed in immune cells, including macrophages and microglia, and mediates cholesterol transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Alprazolam’s anticonvulsant effects are thought to involve TSPO-mediated inhibition of glutamate release and subsequent neuronal hyperpolarization, suggesting a potential link to CRC’s metabolic dysregulation. However, alprazolam’s effects on CRC may be complex, as it also has antioxidant properties that could counteract inflammation-related carcinogenesis. This suggests that alprazolam’s effects on CRC may depend on the specific context and timing of administration, and more research is needed to clarify its mechanistic links to CRC."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Alprazolam’s effects on CRC may involve neuroinflammation-related pathways, including glutamatergic signaling, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. These pathways can contribute to CRC pathogenesis by promoting inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and genomic instability, which are key features of CRC. Alprazolam’s effects on CRC may also involve interactions with other drugs used to treat anxiety and depression, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have been linked to CRC risk and may share similar mechanisms involving inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. However, the specific mechanisms linking alprazolam to CRC remain unclear and require further investigation."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The evidence linking alprazolam to CRC is limited and conflicting, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. While alprazolam’s effects on neuroinflammation suggest a potential link to CRC, its anticonvulsant and antioxidant properties may counteract CRC development in some contexts. More research is needed to clarify the role of alprazolam in CRC and its interactions with other drugs used to treat anxiety and depression.""

  ""Mechanism"": ""Paroxetine is an antidepressant that inhibits the serotonin transporter (SERT), thereby increasing extracellular serotonin levels and acting as an antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors. This suggests that paroxetine may exert antitumor effects by inhibiting SERT and reducing serotonin uptake into tumor cells, which can promote tumor growth and metastasis. Serotonin signaling has been implicated in colorectal cancer progression, where serotonin receptor activation can promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis, suggesting that paroxetine may have antitumor effects in CRC via this pathway."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite, and pain perception, and is also present in the gut and associated with gastrointestinal function. In the context of colorectal cancer, serotonin can promote tumor growth and metastasis through its interactions with serotonin receptors on tumor cells and surrounding tissues. Serotonin receptors are a group of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate serotonin signaling and are classified into seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) and ligand-gated ion channels. The 7TMRs include five classical (5-HT1–5-HT5) receptors and two molecularly distinct 5-HT7 receptors. Activation of these receptors can stimulate intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In CRC, serotonin receptors have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis, and their expression can vary across tumor types and stages. For example, 5-HT1E receptor expression is upregulated in CRC and may promote tumor growth and metastasis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. 5-HT2B receptor expression is associated with CRC metastasis and may promote tumor angiogenesis via the MAPK/ERK pathway. These findings suggest that paroxetine may exert antitumor effects in CRC via its interactions with serotonin receptors and associated signaling pathways."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""While paroxetine is an antidepressant that can inhibit the serotonin transporter (SERT) and modulate serotonin signaling, it is not clear whether these effects directly relate to colorectal cancer biology. Additionally, while some studies have reported associations between serotonin receptor expression and CRC, the specific receptors implicated vary across studies and findings are not always consistent. Therefore, it is unclear how paroxetine may affect CRC risk or progression via its interactions with serotonin receptors.""

  ""Mechanism"": ""Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT), leading to increased extracellular serotonin levels and enhanced serotonergic signaling. This can affect various brain circuits involved in mood regulation, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. SSRIs are commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders, and escitalopram is one of the most widely prescribed antidepressants. The PDB IDs provided relate to structures of the serotonin transporter and its complexes with ligands, including escitalopram and other SSRIs."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biogenic amine that acts as a neurotransmitter and signaling molecule throughout the body. In the brain, 5-HT plays a role in mood regulation, appetite, sleep, pain, and other physiological processes. 5-HT exerts its biological effects by binding to G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels and by modulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. The 5-HT system is complex, involving several receptor subtypes, splice variants, and intracellular signaling pathways. The specific pathways involved in escitalopram’s effects on colorectal cancer are unknown, but escitalopram’s antidepressant effects may be relevant to depression-related changes in colorectal cancer. Depression is a common comorbidity in patients with colorectal cancer, and depression has been linked to worse prognosis and survival in CRC patients. Depression-associated changes in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, immune system, and metabolic and inflammatory processes may contribute to CRC progression and severity. These pathways could potentially interact with 5-HT signaling pathways to mediate escitalopram’s effects on colorectal cancer, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The evidence linking escitalopram to colorectal cancer is limited to observational studies showing an association between antidepressant use and colorectal cancer risk. The specific mechanisms by which escitalopram might influence colorectal cancer are not well understood, and the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the available evidence.""

Sertraline,Serotonin transporter,"6VRL,6VRK,6VRH,7TXT,7LWD,5I6Z,6W2C,6W2B,6DZZ,6AWN,7LIA,7LI9,7LI8,7LI6,6AWQ,6AWP,6AWO,5I75,5I74,5I73,5I71,5I6X,7MGW,7LI7,6DZV,6DZY,6DZW,8DE4,8DE3","{
  ""Mechanism"": ""Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT), thereby increasing extracellular serotonin levels and acting as an antidepressant. SERT is a sodium- and chloride-dependent transporter located in presynaptic neuronal membranes that reuptakes serotonin from the synapse into the presynaptic neuron. Sertraline competitively inhibits this transporter, preventing serotonin clearance and allowing more serotonin to remain in the synapse, where it can act on postsynaptic receptors and exert its pharmacological effects. This suggests that sertraline’s antidepressant effects are mediated by increased serotonergic transmission in the central nervous system."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter that acts through G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and plays a role in mood regulation, appetite, pain, sleep, and other physiological processes. Serotonin receptors are distributed throughout the body, including in the gastrointestinal tract, where they influence motility, secretion, and visceral perception. Serotonin receptors are also expressed in immune cells, where they regulate inflammation and immune responses. Serotonin receptor activation can lead to vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and thrombosis, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease. Serotonin receptors are also expressed in tumor cells and can promote tumor growth and metastasis. The association between serotonin receptors and colorectal cancer is complex and may involve multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival, and the MAPK/ERK pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Serotonin receptor activation can also modulate immune responses, which may affect tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy. Therefore, sertraline’s antidepressant effects may have implications for colorectal cancer through its effects on serotonin signaling pathways and immune responses."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The evidence linking sertraline to colorectal cancer is limited and conflicting. Some studies suggest that sertraline use may increase the risk of colorectal cancer, potentially through its effects on serotonin signaling pathways, while others report no such association. The underlying mechanisms are unclear and may involve multiple signaling pathways, including those related to serotonin receptor activation, inflammation, and immune responses.

  ""Mechanism"": ""Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT), leading to increased extracellular serotonin levels and modulation of serotonergic signaling. SSRIs are used to treat depression by increasing neurotransmitter availability at synapses, which can affect neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. In colon cancer, SERT expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, suggesting a role for serotonin signaling in CRC pathogenesis. However, it is unclear whether fluoxetine’s effects on SERT would directly impact CRC biology or CRC treatment. "",
  ""Pathways"": ""Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biogenic amine that acts as a neurotransmitter and hormone, regulating diverse physiological processes including mood, appetite, sleep, pain, temperature regulation, and gastrointestinal motility. 5-HT exerts its biological effects via seven G protein–coupled receptors (5-HTRs), which are divided into A, B, and D subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D; long-term regulation) and E, F, and G subtypes (5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C; acute regulation).

  ""Mechanism"": ""Selegiline is a reversible, competitive monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor that blocks the breakdown of catecholamines, such as dopamine, by MAO-B, thereby increasing synaptic dopamine levels. This can lead to increased dopaminergic neurotransmission, which may be relevant to Parkinson's disease, where selegiline is used as an antiparkinsonian agent."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) are flavoproteins that catalyze the oxidative deamination of a wide range of biogenic and xenobiotic amines, including monoamines (e.g., serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and trace amines (e.g., tryptamine, phenylethylamine, and tyramine). MAO-mediated amine oxidation leads to the formation of aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia, and plays a role in the catabolism of neurotransmitters and biogenic amines. Inhibition of MAO-B can increase synaptic dopamine levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects, which could be relevant to colorectal cancer pathophysiology. Colorectal cancer is associated with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and alterations in monoamine metabolism, and MAO inhibitors have been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer based on preclinical evidence of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in colorectal cancer cell lines. However, the evidence base is limited and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAO inhibitors in colorectal cancer patients."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""There is limited evidence on the direct effects of selegiline on colorectal cancer, and the proposed mechanism of action (inhibition of MAO-B leading to increased synaptic dopamine levels) is based on findings in other diseases. The relevance of selegiline to colorectal cancer is unclear, and the proposed signalling pathways linking selegiline to colorectal cancer are speculative.""
