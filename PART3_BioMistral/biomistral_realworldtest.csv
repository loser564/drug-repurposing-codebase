Metformin,Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2,"3FF6,3TDC,2X24,3JRX,3JRW,2HJW,4HQ6,5KKN,3GLK,3GID,2DN8","{
  ""Mechanism"": ""Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent used to treat type 2 diabetes, thought to exert its effects via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and activation of AMPK, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production and increased peripheral glucose uptake."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The metabolic effects of metformin are plausibly relevant to CRC biology, but the evidence is indirect and does not implicate a specific signalling pathway. Metformin may reduce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which are risk factors for CRC and may contribute to tumor growth via IGF-1/PI3K/mTOR and other signalling pathways. Metformin may also directly inhibit mTOR signalling, which can suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis. However, metformin’s effects on mTOR are complex and context-dependent, and it is unclear whether metformin’s effects on mTOR signalling in CRC are beneficial or detrimental."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The abstract provides no details on the chemical structure or molecular targets of the small molecules, so it is unclear how they relate to metformin. The abstract also does not provide any mechanistic or pathophysiological context beyond diabetes, so it is difficult to interpret how metformin might relate to CRC biology.""

There is no evidence presented that pioglitazone has a direct or specific connection to colorectal cancer biology, and the abstract does not discuss potential downstream signaling pathways or biochemical mechanisms that could connect pioglitazone treatment to CRC biology. The abstract suggests that pioglitazone might exert an anticancer effect via improved glycemic control in diabetic patients, but it does not provide evidence that pioglitazone has a clinically meaningful effect on glucose homeostasis in the context of CRC.

  ""Mechanism"": ""Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes by reducing hyperglycemia. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a serine protease expressed in many tissues including the gut, where it cleaves peptides such as incretins that modulate insulin secretion in response to food intake. DPP4 is also expressed in immune cells and can modulate inflammatory responses, and DPP4 inhibition has been linked to reduced tumor-associated inflammation and improved survival in murine models of colon cancer. This suggests a plausible mechanism whereby linagliptin could reduce hyperglycemia by blocking DPP4-mediated degradation of incretins, while also exerting anti-inflammatory effects in the tumor microenvironment that could benefit CRC patients. However, linagliptin’s effects on DPP4-mediated signaling are complex and can involve multiple pathways, and it’s unclear how these would interact with CRC biology. For example, DPP4 can activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via cleavage of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which can promote tumor proliferation and metastasis in some contexts but may also have tumor-suppressive effects in CRC. Overall, linagliptin’s dual glucose-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects suggest a plausible link to CRC biology, but the specific signaling pathways involved are complex and uncertain."",

  ""Mechanism"": ""Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes by lowering blood glucose via urinary glucose excretion, and SGLT2 is a transmembrane protein expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The antidiabetic effect of dapagliflozin is mediated by reducing intracellular sodium concentration in proximal tubule cells, which inhibits sodium-hydrogen exchange (NHE3) and thereby increases intracellular pH and sodium-dependent phosphate reabsorption (NaPi-IIa). This reduces proximal tubule reabsorption of sodium and phosphate, leading to increased delivery of sodium and phosphate to distal nephron segments, including the loop of Henle and collecting ducts. In the loop of Henle, increased delivery of sodium and phosphate leads to increased osmotic water reabsorption, resulting in concentrated urine. In the collecting ducts, increased delivery of sodium and phosphate inhibits vasopressin-mediated water reabsorption, leading to dilute urine. The net effect is reduced sodium and phosphate reabsorption and increased urinary excretion of sodium and phosphate, which can lead to reductions in extracellular fluid volume and intravascular volume. These changes may be relevant to colorectal cancer (CRC) biology through mechanisms involving sodium-phosphate co-transport and phosphate homeostasis. For example, phosphate depletion can inhibit insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling, which has been implicated in CRC growth and metastasis, and phosphate depletion can also promote osteopontin expression, which has been linked to CRC progression and metastasis. However, it is unclear whether dapagliflozin-mediated effects on phosphate homeostasis are relevant to CRC biology, and there are no known direct links between SGLT2 inhibition and CRC. Overall, while there is some potential for dapagliflozin to affect CRC biology via phosphate-related mechanisms, the connection is highly speculative and requires further investigation. "",

PPARγ is expressed in colon cancer cells, where it can promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis by regulating downstream genes involved in cell cycle progression and survival pathways. Therefore, rosiglitazone may exert tumor-promoting effects in CRC via PPARγ-mediated signaling.

Pathways: The main downstream signaling pathways of PPARγ include insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Wnt/β-catenin. Rosiglitazone can activate these pathways to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, thereby potentially contributing to CRC carcinogenesis.

Uncertainties: The direct link between rosiglitazone and CRC is unclear, as rosiglitazone primarily exerts metabolic effects and its effects on cancer are largely indirect. Additionally, the specific mechanisms by which rosiglitazone interacts with PPARγ and relevant signaling pathways in CRC require further investigation.

Follow-ups: Experimental follow-ups could include in vitro studies examining the effects of rosiglitazone on CRC cell lines, as well as in vivo studies using preclinical models to investigate the role of PPARγ signaling in rosiglitazone-induced CRC.

SERT is a sodium- and chloride-dependent transporter that regulates extracellular serotonin levels by taking up serotonin from the synaptic cleft into presynaptic neurons. In colon cancer, SERT expression is increased and associated with worse survival, suggesting that SERT may promote tumor progression. This could potentially be related to paroxetine’s antitumor effects in CRC, but the evidence is indirect and unclear."",
  ""Pathways"": ""In CRC, SERT expression is associated with increased proliferation and angiogenesis, suggesting that SERT may promote tumor growth and metastasis. However, it is unclear whether this is a direct effect of SERT or related to the tumor microenvironment. Paroxetine has been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer, but it is unknown whether this mechanism applies to CRC or whether it is related to SERT inhibition. Overall, the link between SERT and CRC is plausible but requires further investigation."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The provided PDB IDs suggest that paroxetine binds to the extracellular domain of SERT, which is involved in serotonin uptake and neurotransmission. However, it is unclear whether paroxetine can access SERT in the context of CRC and whether it exerts similar effects on tumor biology. Additionally, the study linking SERT expression to CRC outcomes did not involve paroxetine, so it is unclear whether paroxetine-mediated SERT inhibition would have a similar effect. Finally, the study implicating SERT in tumor angiogenesis was conducted in breast cancer, so it is unclear whether this mechanism applies to CRC or whether it is related to SERT inhibition.""

Escitalopram,Serotonin transporter,"6VRL,6VRK,6VRH,7TXT,7LWD,5I6Z,6W2C,6W2B,6DZZ,6AWN,7LIA,7LI9,7LI8,7LI6,6AWQ,6AWP,6AWO,5I75,5I74,5I73,5I71,5I6X,7MGW,7LI7,6DZV,6DZY,6DZW,8DE4,8DE3","{
  ""Mechanism"": ""Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression, and the
  abstract mentions that SSRI use is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer in observational studies.
  The abstract proposes a mechanism whereby SSRIs increase tumor vascularity and angiogenesis, which could
  plausibly promote tumor growth and progression in CRC. This is consistent with findings in other cancers
  (e.g. breast cancer) where SSRIs have been linked to increased tumor angiogenesis and worse outcomes,
  suggesting a common underlying biology across cancer types."",
  ""Pathways"": ""The abstract suggests that SSRIs increase tumor angiogenesis via serotonin receptor signaling,
  which could plausibly activate angiogenic pathways such as VEGF/VEGFR signaling or angiopoietin signaling,
  although the exact molecular mechanisms are not spelled out. The authors also propose that
  SSRI-associated hyperglycemia may contribute to increased tumor glucose metabolism and angiogenesis,
  suggesting a potential link to diabetes-associated CRC risk, but this is speculative and not
  mechanistically supported by the abstract."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""The abstract does not provide mechanistic detail beyond the proposed pathway of
  serotonin receptor signaling activating angiogenic pathways, and it is unclear exactly how
  SSRI-mediated serotonin reuptake inhibition would lead to increased serotonin signaling. The
  abstract also does not provide detail on the specific serotonin receptor(s) involved or how
  SSRI-mediated receptor antagonism might affect downstream signaling. Finally, while the
  abstract proposes a link between SSRI use and diabetes, which is known to increase CRC risk,
  it does not provide evidence that SSRI-associated hyperglycemia is driving increased angiogenesis
  or CRC risk in this proposed pathway.""

  ""Mechanism"": ""Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. It blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT), thereby increasing extracellular serotonin levels and modulating serotonergic neurotransmission. SERT is a sodium- and chloride-dependent transporter expressed in neurons and epithelial cells throughout the body, including the gut. SERT is also expressed in colon cancer cells, where it mediates uptake of serotonin into the tumor cells and regulates intratumoral serotonin levels. Serotonin can promote tumor growth and metastasis by activating proliferative and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, suggesting that sertraline may have antitumor effects in CRC by blocking serotonin uptake into tumor cells and reducing local serotonin signaling."",
  ""Pathways"": ""Sertraline’s effects on colon cancer may involve serotonin-mediated signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is activated by serotonin and plays a role in CRC carcinogenesis. Sertraline may also affect other signaling pathways involved in CRC biology, such as the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is implicated in CRC metastasis and can be regulated by serotonin signaling. However, it is unclear whether sertraline’s effects on these pathways are direct or indirect, and whether they are relevant to CRC biology in vivo. No studies have directly examined the effects of sertraline on CRC signaling pathways or CRC biology in animal models or patients with CRC, so the relevance of these pathways to sertraline’s effects on CRC remains uncertain."",
  ""Uncertainties"": ""There are no published studies examining the effects of sertraline on CRC signaling pathways or CRC biology in animal models or patients with CRC, so the relevance of these pathways to sertraline’s effects on CRC remains unclear.
