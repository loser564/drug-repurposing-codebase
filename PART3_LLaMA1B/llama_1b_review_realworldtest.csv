The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) biology.
Evidence:
- GLP1R is involved in metabolic regulation, insulin secretion, and appetite control.
- GLP1R signaling has been implicated in CRC progression and metastasis.
- GLP1R inhibitors have shown potential in treating CRC, including in combination with other therapies.

Mechanism:
Semaglutide, a GLP1R agonist, acts by enhancing insulin secretion and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIIP) release, which can promote insulin signaling and potentially inhibit CRC progression.

Pathways:
- The GLP1R signaling pathway is known to be involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascades, both of which are implicated in CRC.
- GLP1R signaling can also influence the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation.
- The GLP1R pathway may interact with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, given their overlapping roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

Uncertainties:
- While GLP1R signaling is implicated in CRC, the direct mechanistic link between semaglutide treatment and CRC outcomes is unclear.
- The involvement of GLP1R in metabolic regulation might suggest a broader metabolic role in CRC, but this does not directly relate to CRC biology.
- The involvement of GLP1R in signaling cascades (PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin) suggests potential downstream effects on CRC, but these are speculative.

Follow-up Steps:
- Examine pathway interactions and downstream signaling pathways to strengthen the evidence.
- Investigate potential mechanisms through which GLP1R signaling could influence CRC progression and metastasis.
- Consider whether the observed effects on metabolism and insulin signaling could provide insights into CRC biology.

NO RELATION
This proposal does not establish a plausible mechanistic link between semaglutide treatment and colorectal cancer outcomes.
Explanation:
- While GLP1R signaling is implicated in CRC, the evidence linking semaglutide treatment to CRC outcomes is indirect and speculative.

The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GLP1R signaling has been implicated in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis through various mechanisms.

The proposed drug repurposing mechanism for Liraglutide involves its potential impact on GLP1R signaling in colorectal cancer. Liraglutide is known to affect GLP1R levels and activity in the body. By examining the effects of Liraglutide on GLP1R expression and signaling pathways in colorectal cancer, we can assess whether there is a mechanistically plausible link between Liraglutide and CRC.

Based on the provided PDB IDs, we can hypothesize that Liraglutide may interact with GLP1R in a manner that promotes CRC progression. For example, Liraglutide may inhibit the activity of GLP1R, leading to increased glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, which can contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis in colorectal cancer.

However, it is essential to note that the proposed mechanism is speculative, as there is limited direct evidence linking Liraglutide to GLP1R signaling in colorectal cancer. Therefore, we should exercise caution and avoid overstating weak or indirect evidence.

Given the current understanding of GLP1R signaling in colorectal cancer, we can conclude that there is a plausible mechanistic link between Liraglutide and CRC.

Pathways:
The proposed mechanism suggests that Liraglutide may activate pathways that promote colorectal cancer progression, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This pathway is known to be involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis in colorectal cancer.

Uncertainties:
While the proposed mechanism suggests a plausible link between Liraglutide and CRC, there are several uncertainties that need to be addressed. These include:

* The specific molecular interactions between Liraglutide and GLP1R that underlie the proposed mechanism.
* The potential for alternative mechanisms or pathways to mediate the effects of Liraglutide on GLP1R signaling in colorectal cancer.
* The need for further experimental and clinical validation to confirm the proposed mechanism.

Concrete experimental or clinical follow-up steps:
To validate the proposed mechanism, we should conduct pathway assays and examine the effects of Liraglutide on colorectal cancer cell lines and murine models. We should also investigate the potential downstream signalling pathways that connect Liraglutide to GLP1R signalling in colorectal cancer.

Proposed concrete experimental or clinical follow-up steps:

1. Pathway assays: Examine the effects of Liraglutide on colorectal cancer cell lines and murine models using pathway-specific assays, such as those targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
2. Immunohistochemistry: Investigate the expression of GLP1R and other target receptors in colorectal cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry.
3. Xenograft models: Examine the effects of Liraglutide on colorectal cancer progression in mouse models using xenograft models.
4. Small proof-of-concept trials: Conduct small proof-of-concept trials to assess the efficacy of Liraglutide in reducing colorectal cancer-related mortality and improving quality of life.

The drug Lixisenatide targets the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R).

Evidence:
- The GLP1R is involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling.
- GLP1R activation can lead to increased insulin levels, which may promote tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.
- However, the evidence linking GLP1R activation to colorectal cancer is indirect and based on animal studies.

Mechanism:
The proposed mechanism involves GLP1R activation leading to increased insulin levels, which may promote tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.

Downstream Signalling Pathways:
Speculative links:
- EGFR/MAPK pathway: Although GLP1R activation can lead to increased insulin levels, which may promote tumorigenesis, there is no direct evidence linking GLP1R activation to the EGFR/MAPK pathway in colorectal cancer.
- PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: Similarly, there is no direct evidence linking GLP1R activation to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in colorectal cancer.
- Wnt/β-catenin pathway: There is no evidence linking GLP1R activation to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer.
- Other pathways: There is no evidence linking GLP1R activation to other pathways relevant to colorectal cancer.

Uncertainties:
- Lack of direct evidence linking GLP1R activation to colorectal cancer outcomes.
- Insufficient evidence to support a mechanistic link between GLP1R activation and colorectal cancer.

Recommendations:
- Further research is needed to establish a mechanistic link between GLP1R activation and colorectal cancer outcomes.
- Experimental studies should aim to replicate the observed effects in colorectal cancer models.

The drug Tirzepatide targets the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R).
PDB IDs: 7FIM,7RTB,9J1P,9IVM,9IVG,9EBQ,9EBO,9EBN,9C0K,9BYO,8YWF,8YW3,8WG7,8JIR,8JIP,7VBI,7VBH,7S3I,7S1M,7LLL,7LCI,7KI0,7EVM,7E14,7DUQ,7C2E,6X1A,6X19,6X18,6ORV,6B3J,7X8S,7X8R,7RG9,6GB1,5OTX,5OTV,5OTU,5OTT

Evidence:
- GLP1R is involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling.
- GLP1R is also implicated in colorectal cancer through its role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
- Tirzepatide has been shown to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in preclinical models of colorectal cancer.

Mechanism:
Tirzepatide binds to GLP1R, which then inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is known to play a critical role in colorectal cancer progression.

Downstream Signalling Pathways:
- The inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by GLP1R is mediated through the activation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway.
- Activation of the MAPK pathway leads to the phosphorylation and activation of various transcription factors, including EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and AKT (protein kinase B).
- Activation of these pathways can lead to the upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and migration, all of which are hallmarks of colorectal cancer.

NO RELATION.

Uncertainties:
- The direct mechanistic link between GLP1R inhibition and colorectal cancer progression is unclear.
- Alternative explanations for the observed effects include the potential for GLP1R inhibition to affect other signaling pathways or pathways involved in colorectal cancer development.

Follow-up Steps:
- To better understand the mechanistic basis of the observed effects, perform pathway assays using Tirzepatide and colorectal cancer cell lines.
- Investigate the potential impact of GLP1R inhibition on other signaling pathways or pathways involved in colorectal cancer development.
- Consider whether the observed effects could be explained by alternative mechanisms involving other pathways or pathways not directly related to colorectal cancer progression.",reviewer

Human regular,,,"""<Assess the proposed drug repurposing mechanism for colorectal cancer; it appears to lack a mechanistically plausible link to colorectal cancer. The proposed binding or modulation of the receptor(s) via drug may not be directly relevant to colorectal cancer biology. Potential downstream signalling pathways include EGFR/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin; however, these links appear speculative. Uncertainties include the relevance of pathway assays, xenograft models, and small proof-of-concept trials to validating this mechanism. Suggested follow-up experiments include pathway assays, xenograft models, and small proof-of-concept trials to validate the mechanism.""

Justified explanation:
The provided evidence includes Selegiline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, with associated PDB IDs. However, there is no clear mechanistic link between Selegiline and colorectal cancer biology. The evidence does not support a plausible CRC connection.

Key points:
- No evidence supports a plausible CRC mechanism involving Selegiline.
- There are no plausible downstream signalling pathways connecting Selegiline to colorectal cancer.
- Uncertainties include the lack of evidence linking Selegiline to colorectal cancer biology.

Recommendations:
- Further research is required to explore potential CRC mechanisms involving Selegiline.
- Pathway assays, xenograft models, and small proof-of-concept trials may be necessary to validate the mechanism.
- Consideration should be given to potential alternative explanations for the observed effects.
- Potential follow-up steps include examining the role of other substrates or co-factors in the metabolic pathway of Selegiline, or investigating the potential impact of Selegiline on other pathways involved in colorectal cancer.",reviewer
